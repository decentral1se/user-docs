title: Updating your profile
---

Snikket allows you to set a profile picture and display name for your account.
By default this information is visible to anyone who knows your Snikket
address, but you can also change your [profile visibility](/profile/visibility/).

## Setting a profile picture

Your profile picture will be used in the Snikket app to help other users more
easily recognise you. If you do not choose a profile picture, the first letter
of your username will be shown instead.

## Setting your display name

Your display name is the name that other Snikket users will see when you chat
with them. By default, your account username is used but you have a choice of
changing it something you find more suitable.
