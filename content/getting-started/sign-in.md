## Adding a new device to your account

Snikket allows you to connect multiple devices to the same account. This way
you can send and receive messages and calls on any of your linked devices.

When you add a new device to your account, it will synchronize your Snikket
contacts and any groups you are part of. However it will not have access to
your account's previous encrypted message, media and files.

To add a new device to your account, simply install the Snikket app on your
device, and tap "Sign in". Enter your full Snikket address and your password.
If you're not sure what your password is, check the [forgotten password](forgot-password/)
instructions.

## Migrating from an old device

If you want to move to a new device (and stop using Snikket on the old device)
you can transfer your account and conversation history.
