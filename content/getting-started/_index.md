{{< lead >}}Welcome to Snikket! We want to make sure you have a great time, so this
section has everything you need to know about getting set up with an account,
and signing in using the Snikket app.{{< /lead >}}

## First time?

If you have received an invitation to join Snikket, read about [how
to accept a Snikket invitation](accept-invitation/). If you don't have an
invitation and would like to use Snikket, you need to [start your own Snikket
instance](https://snikket.org/service/) or if you already know someone who has
one, ask them for an invitation.

## Existing accounts
    
If you already have an account, learn how to [sign in to your account](sign-in/).
Once you are set up, you can learn more about adding, removing and backing up
your account data in [Managing Your Accounts](managing-accounts/).
